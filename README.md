## Project Idea : Referral & Alumni Interaction Portal

<br/>
<br/>

<p style="text-align:justify">
The aim of this project is to build a system that will be able to manage alumni data of our college and provide access to the same to the students and faculty members. Alumni of a college generally stay in touch with their immediate friends but find it hard to stay connected with other college mates. Contact between alumni can be used to forge business connections and to gain referrals or insight in a new field. New college students will be initially given a SID which will act as their login credential for the portal. Access to the system can help them in building connections to help them in their projects or for placements and internships.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
The system will automatically list all college students as alumni on their graduation and their account status will be transferred from the student section to the alumni section. Users will be prompted to update social network details such as their Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter handles. There will be a feed section where the users can choose to automatically share new updates in work status from their LinkedIn profile. Users will also be able to share and promote their business Facebook pages or Twitter handles through the system.This single system will be able to bypass the requirement of any other Alumni organization. The system can track user location as given by the user. Once the system notices that more than 10 alumni are available in the same city it can notify all of them about the possibility of a meet.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
 Alumni will also be able to provide public posts on the system about possible job opportunities or other college related news. Since it is unlikely that alumni will check the system frequently but the system will be able to collate all public posts and create a newsletter that can be emailed to all alumni.
